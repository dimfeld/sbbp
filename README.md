# Should've Been a Blog Post

How often have you watched a YouTube video and thought "I just spent 45 minutes watching this thing and could have
skimmed a blog post and got the same value?" Or maybe you have limited free time, and after putting the kids to bed,
doing the dishes, and so on, you barely even have time to watch a video before bed.

This tool helps with that, using Whisper to obtain a high quality transcript and placing images alongside the text so you
don't miss out on the visuals too.

This is a work in progress. The core application works but the layout needs some tweaking to improve the reading
experience.
